# Climate Circles
## Milestone Project One
***
This webite was created for Alexandra Brinzac, a psychologist specialised in experiential psychotherapy, with a passion for climate psychology, ecopsycholgy and nature-based therapies. After all the studies and experience that she gathered, she decided it's time to move further and create "Climate Circles", a place for people with the same love for nature, connection and Planet Earth. The role of this website is to raise awareness  about the importance of being in a circle and working together towards creating a just regenerative world. The means that we are reaching this are workshops of The World That Reconnects, Climate Circles and Forest Bathing sessions.

## Surface

### Imagery

The Images from the Workshops, In the About Page were given by Alexandra from her workshops, as the photo from "Meet Alexandra" on the Home Page.
I chose the Hero image from the Home page because of the simple feeling that sends you when you look at it, giving you a peaceful vibe when entering the website. The images from the "Meet-up Times" section were chosen to match the vibes of the workshops. In the background of the Contact Form I have chosen the stem of a tree for the nice contrast and also to keep the nature theme on the entire website.
