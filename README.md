# Climate Circles
## Milestone Project One

This website was created for Alexandra Brinzac, a psychologist specialised in experiential psychotherapy with a passion for climate psychology, ecopsychology, and nature-based therapies. After all the studies and experience that she gathered, she decided it was time to move further and create "Climate Circles" a place for people with the same love for nature, connection, and Planet Earth. The role of this website is to raise awareness about the importance of being in a circle and working together towards creating a just and regenerative world. We are achieving this goal through workshops such as "The World That Reconnects," Climate Circles, and Forest Bathing sessions.

## Surface

### Imagery

The images from the workshops in the About Page were given by Alexandra from her workshops, as was the photo from "Meet Alexandra" on the Home Page.
I chose the Hero image from the Home page because of the simple feeling that it sends you when you look at it, giving you a peaceful vibe when entering the website. The images from the "Meet-up Times" section were chosen to match the vibes of the workshops. I chose a tree stem for the background of the Contact Form to provide a nice contrast and to keep the nature theme consistent throughout the website.

### Colour

I have used three types of green on the entire website, which goes perfect with the theme of the website. I kept the background color white for contrast and also used white in writing on images for the same reason.

### Typography

For my fonts, I used https://fonts.google.com/. I have chosen to use Oswald for headers. Initially, I chose Quicksand for the content, but because the contrast was not sufficient, I changed to Montserrat, which is a similar font but has better contrast and readability. I have increased the letter spacing to make the text more defined and decreased it on smaller screens for responsiveness.

I imported the following code into the top of my style.css file:
```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@500&family=Oswald&display=swap'); 
```
### Call to Action
* * The links in the Navigation bar are highlighted with a border bottom when the mouse is hovered over them.
* On the "About" page, the workshops have been styled as buttons to make them more inviting for users to click. When hovered over, the colors switch.
* The "Submit" button has a nice, earthy brown color that goes perfectly with the background on the "Contact" page. The colors change when hovered over.
* The social media links will send the user to Alexandra's social media pages. They also change colour when hovered over.

## Features
### Navigation Links and Logo


The navigation links and logo are placed at the top of the screen. In bigger screen sizes, the logo stays in the left corner and the navigation links in the right corner of the screen. On smaller screen sizes, the logo is centered, and the navigation links go underneath the logo and are centered. When clicked, the logo takes the user to the home page. The navigation links direct the user to the correct page of the website.


### Responsiveness


The page is scaled up and down for different screen resolutions to help the content stay neat. This has been done using media queries.


### Accessibility


All images and navigations have an alt attribute or aria-label. This is to make the site easier to use for people with visual impairments by allowing them to navigate the site easily. There is high contrast used throughout the design. Header elements have been used in sequence so that the site makes semantic sense to screen readers. Links are consistent when hovered over.


### Footer


The footer is split into two sections: "Contact Info" and "Social Links". On smaller devices, the two sections are stacked, while on larger devices, they are arranged in two columns.
The "Contact Info" section includes the email and telephone number of Alexandra, where she can be reached. The last section with the social links has links to social media sites using icons from Font Awesome. When hovered over, these links change from a lighter green colour to a darker shade of green colour.


### Home Page


Consists of:
* A hero image and a nice quote from Robin Wall Kimmerer to ease users into the website's depths.
* A bio section with information about Alexandra and an image of her. On smaller devices, the two elements are stacked, and on larger devices, they go into two columns. On the smaller devices, there is no letter spacing, and the text is made justified.
* A "Testimonials" section, listing three persons and their nice words about the workshops and Alexandra. On smaller devices, the images become smaller. As in the bio section, on the smaller devices there is no letter spacing, and the text is made justified.
* A section titled "Meet-up Times," which consists of three images with the names, times, and locations of the workshops written on them. On bigger devices, they are presented in a row. When the screen size becomes smaller, they become stacked.


### About Page
* In the first section, I have used a hero image and a container that has a title, a small description of the workshops, and three buttons that send you to each workshop section. On larger devices, the image is kept on the left side of the screen and the container is kept on the right. When the screen size becomes smaller, the image goes into the back of the container.
* For the workshops sections, I have used the same style as for the first section.
* The Workshops sections include a description of the workshops as well as their benefits.
* "The Work That Reconnects" and "Climate Circles" have images taken by Alexandra from the workshops.
* For "Forest Bathing" I have searched for a picture that can relate perfectly with the means of the workshop,


### Contact Us Page


Consists of:
* A Contact Form
* The form includes fields for the user to enter their contact details using - input type="text".
* The email input field requires the answer to be an email.
* There is a - textarea - to allow the user to ask for any further details. I have used placeholder text to encourage the user to make any further comments.
* The submit button is large and changes colour when hovered over.
* The labels are clear as to what should go in the field, and all fields are set to "required".

## Testing
* I tested whether the logo returns the user to the main page.
* I have tested to see if the navigation bar works and the user is sent to the correct page of the site.
* I have tested the buttons on the "About" page to see if they redirect the user to each section.
* I have tested that the "Submit" button works.
* I verified that the social media icons function properly. 

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate all pages of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in there.

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
