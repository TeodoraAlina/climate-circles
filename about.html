                    <p class="description">
                        Since 1978, The Work That Reconnects has inspired millions of people to listen to their hearts and work together
                        for a better life on
                        Earth, despite the general
                        trend of worsening ecological conditions. To learn the basics of The Work That Reconnects and its unique
                        approach, people participate in
                        experiences of varying
                        duration, from a few days to a few weeks. But, The Work That Reconnects extends far beyond these dedicated
                        frameworks. The methods are
                        widely used in schools,
                        communities, organizations, and campaigns for the environment and human rights.
                        The central purpose of this work is to bring people into relationship with the world around them, empowering
                        them to act and take part
                        in "The Great Turning".

                        Forest Bathing is the English translation of the Japanese term "shinrin yoku" (shinrin=forest and yoku=bath). It
                        is the practice of
                        experiencing natural spaces,
                        especially forests, in a slow, purposeful manner. Forest Bathing was developed in the 1980s, and it has become
                        an increasingly important
                        part of Japanese preventive care and therapeutic healing, becoming an antidote
                        to our unnatural, indoor lives. Participants engage all their senses, paying attention to what is happening
                        inside them, outside them,
                        and how these worlds meet and interact.
