            <h2>The Work That Reconnects</h2>
            <p>
                Since 1978, The Work That Reconnects has inspired millions of people to listen to their hearts and work together for a better life on Earth, despite the general
                 trend of worsening ecological conditions. To learn the basics of The Work That Reconnects and its unique approach, people participate in experiences of varying
                 duration, from a few days to a few weeks. But, The Work That Reconnects extends far beyond these dedicated frameworks. The methods are widely used in schools,
                 communities, organizations and campaigns for the environment and human rights.
                 The central purpose of this work is to bring people into relationship with the world around them, empowering them to act and take part in "The Great Turning".
