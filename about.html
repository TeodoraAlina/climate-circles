            <h3 class="description-titles">About</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Since 1978, The Work That Reconnects has inspired millions of people to listen to their hearts and work together for a better life on Earth, despite the general
                 trend of worsening ecological conditions. To learn the basics of The Work That Reconnects and its unique approach, people participate in experiences of varying
                 duration, from a few days to a few weeks. But, The Work That Reconnects extends far beyond these dedicated frameworks. The methods are widely used in schools,
                 communities, organizations and campaigns for the environment and human rights.
                 The central purpose of this work is to bring people into relationship with the world around them, empowering them to act and take part in "The Great Turning".

        <div class="wks-container">
            <h3 class="description-titles">About</h3>
            <p class="description">Forest Bathing is the English translation of the Japanese term “shinrin yoku” (shinrin=forest and yoku=bath). It is the practice of experiencing natural spaces, 
                especially forests, in a slow, purposeful manner. Forest Bathing was developed in 1980s, and it has become an increasingly important part of Japanese preventive care and therapeutic healing, becoming an antidote
                to our unnatural, indoor lives. Participants engage all their senses, paying attention to what is happening inside them, outside and how this worlds meet and interact.
